          Dr Krishnan Anand, has been a Senior Lecturer in Chemical Pathology, Faculty of Health Sciences at the University of the Free State (UFS) since September 2019. Dr Anand
          also participated in the Future Generation Professoriate Group (FGP) at the UFS. He is an internationally recognised researcher working at the forefront of global health
          by aligning his research with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3: 'Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages', which helps him to
          produce relevant research and lifesaving 21st-century metabolic medicines.

          Dr Anand leads the Precision Medicine Integrative Nano Diagnostics (P-MIND) Research Group which is currently engaged in biological functions of extracellular vesicles
          (EVs) in cellular studies conducted under supraphysiological conditions, biomarker discovery through EVs derived from liquid biopsies and the role of circulating
          biomarkers in disease development. This work is important not only for diagnoses but also for treatment monitoring. Studies are also being conducted in OMICS
          technologies, epigenetics, toxicology, interpretation of biomolecules by hyphenated techniques, and the recent development of nanosensors in breath biopsy analysis for
          early and non-invasive disease diagnosis. P-MIND is actively contributing to nanopathology and nanodiagnostics.

          Due to his research and clinical expertise, Dr Anand has 150 research outputs, including several scientific articles in peer-reviewed journals, has authored book
          chapters, and is the editor of seven books (published by Elsevier, Springer, and Wiley respectively). He holds two patents for his work. Of the aforementioned research
          outputs, 80% of the publications rank in the top Q1 and Q2 in their respective disciplines, and he has a Google Scholar H-index of 35 and a Scopus H-index of 30. In
          addition to research, he has successfully supervised and mentored master's and doctoral students and has hosted Postdoctoral Research Fellows. In the latest list
          published by Stanford University, Dr Anand was named in the Top 2% of the most influential scientist worldwide.
