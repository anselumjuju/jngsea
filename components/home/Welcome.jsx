        International Journal of Computer and Communication Engineering (IJCCE) is an international academic open access journal which gains a foothold in Singapore, Asia and opens
        to the world. It aims to promote the integration of computer and communication engineering. The focus is to publish papers on state-of-the-art computer and communication
        engineering. Submitted papers will be reviewed by technical committees of the Journal and Association. The audience includes researchers, managers and operators for
        computer and communication engineering as well as designers and developers. All submitted articles should report original, previously unpublished research results,
        experimental or theoretical, and will be peer- reviewed. Articles submitted to the journal should meet these criteria and must not be under consideration for publication
        elsewhere. Manuscripts should follow the style of the journal and are subject to both review and editing.
